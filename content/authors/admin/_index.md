Hi! I am a PhD student in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI) at [UC San Diego](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/), advised by [Dr. Biwei Huang](https://biweihuang.com/).
I build scalable causal learning methods that help foundation models and agents learn structured world models—supporting robust generalization and long-horizon decision making.

My recent work spans causal learning from time series at scale, causality-guided world modeling for reinforcement learning generalization, and agentic systems for end-to-end causal analysis. Before joining UCSD, I worked with [Dr. Konrad Kording](http://koerding.com/) on learning domain-specific causal discovery for large complex systems. I am also interested in brain-computer interfaces and computational neuroscience, and previously worked on neurofeedback systems advised by [Dr. Gan Huang](https://huanggan.site/).
