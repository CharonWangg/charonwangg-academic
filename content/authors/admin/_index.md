Hi! I am a PhD student in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI) at [University of California San Diego](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/).
My research interest lays in the intersection of Causality and Machine Learning, include Causal Discovery, Causal Representation Learning 
and Causal Machine Learning. My ultimate question thinking now is, can we develop a world model based on causality with the self-consistent loop of
autonomously Causal Discovery and Causal Inference.

Currently, I am doing causality-related research in HDSI, supervised by [Dr. Biwei Huang](https://biweihuang.com/). Before joining in UCSD,
I was a MSE student in [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), majored in Bioengineering. My master thesis 
is about Learning Domain-specific Causal Discovery in large complex system, conducted in [KordingLab](http://kordinglab.com/), advised by 
[Dr. Konrad Kording](http://koerding.com/). Prior to UPenn, I earned a BEng degree in Biomedical 
Engineering from [Shenzhen University](https://bme.szu.edu.cn/#) and conducted the Neural Feedback System 
development in [MINDLab](http://www.zgzhang-lab.net/), Advised by [Dr. Gan Huang](https://huanggan.site/). 
Meanwhile, I am a data science enthusiast and excited about applying machine learning to solve real-world problems, have won multiple medals on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
