Hi! I am a master student in the Department of Bioengineering at [University of Pennsylvania](https://be.seas.upenn.edu/). 
My research interests include Causal Discovery, Causal Machine Learning and Machine Learning 
Application in Biomedical Informatics. 

Currently, I am doing research about Meta-learning Causal Discovery in large complex system, advised by 
[Dr. Konrad Kording](http://koerding.com/). Prior to UPenn, I earned a BEng degree in Biomedical 
Engineering from [Shenzhen University](https://bme.szu.edu.cn/#) and conducted the Neural Feedback System 
development in [MINDLab](http://www.zgzhang-lab.net/), Advised by [Dr. Gan Huang](https://huanggan.site/). Meanwhile, I am a data science enthusiast, have 
won multiple medals on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 

Looking for a 2023 fall PhD position, contact me if you are interested in my background and experience!
