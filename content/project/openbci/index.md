The neural oscillation in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is
highly related to peopleâ€™s psychological cognitive ability. In this
work, an OpenBCI version of phase-locked feedback control system
has been implemented for real time alpha wave regulation. As
compared with the distributed system architecture on Brainamp,
PC and Arduino in the previous work, the new proposed system has
integrated all the modules for signal acquisition, phase estimation
and applying stimulation on one chip. Hence, the delay for signal
transmission can be effectively eliminated, which leads to a better
accuracy for phase estimation in phase-locked feedback control.
The results show the effective of the proposed system to alpha wave
regulation, which has significant modulation advantages in amplitude 
and frequency compared to Distributed BrainProduct Architectures.

Besides, we develop a PyQtGraph-based visualization tool for real-time 
monitoring on host computer, streaming data from OpenBCI board by Bluetooth 2.0
protocols.
