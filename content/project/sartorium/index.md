Neurological disorders have caused increasing death and disability across the globe,
which increases the demand for corresponding treatment and rehabilitation. As a
key step in neurological disorders drug development, neuronal cells segmentation in
light microscopy is vital to obtain deadly disordersâ€™ response to treatment. However,
common manual neuronal cells instance segmentation is inefficient, time-intensive, and
labor-costing. To automatically and accurately segment neuronal cells from images,
we developed a neuronal cells instance segmentation system, including an instance
segmentation model based on Cascade Mask R-CNN X152 and a customized post-
processing pipeline.

In this project, we first adopted various training skills like large-scale training, 
multi-scale jittering, copy-paste augmentation and etc to train a robust baseline based on
Cascade Mask R-CNN X152. According to the characteristics of the dataset, we implemented several
effective post process methods such as mask screening, overlapping removal, small instance removal 
and etc to reduce false positives. We conducted model inference on the unlabeled data set, LiveCell, 
to get the peseudo-label in a semi-supervised way. After screening semi-supervised data by prediction 
confidence, we combine them into a bigger training set and conduct multiple rounds fine-tuning by repeating 
the previous steps. Finally, to avoid the negative effect of naively fuse instance segmentation models, 
we invented a cascade IoU screening method to fuse the prediction results
from six models of different folds and seeds to get the final result. Test time augmentation included flipping 
and resize are used in the all inference process. 

The resulting robust segmentation system leverages several techniques to achieve 33.5% mAP and 34.5% mAP 
on the public and private leaderboard, leading to the top 1% place on Kaggle Sartorius Cell Instance Segmentation Competition. 
This work potentially provides an efficient and effective alternative for manually 
segmenting neuronal cells, which saves labor costs and further facilitates 
drug development in curing neurological disorders.
