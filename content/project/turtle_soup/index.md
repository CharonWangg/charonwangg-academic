Situation puzzle is a popular text-based interactive game. In
such a game, there is a moderator and a player, or a group
of players. The moderator has a complete story in mind and
provides the player(s) with the beginning and the ending of
a story; the player(s), on the other hand, are expected to
figure out the step-by-step details of story development by
asking the moderator ”yes-or-no” questions about the story.
The game would end either when the player(s) figure out
the complete story line or when a preset number of ques-
tions are asked before complete the story. The challenging
and intriguing part of this game is that the player(s) need to
come up with a story with only the beginning and the ending
while also make sure the logical relations in the story align
with commonsense.

We propose to build a system (TurtleSoup) that not only
automatically generate high-quality story for a situation puz-
zle game but also handles the job of the moderator to in-
teract with player(s). With minimum human intervention,
TurtleSoup is capable of providing comprehensive interac-
tive experience that can be entertaining.
